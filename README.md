Section 2: Details of the Application 

Q1: What are we trying to resolve?  

We are trying to provide a fully enjoyable tennis experience for people who love to play tennis but need to find the right practice players, ideal local tennis court or suitable weather to play. 

Current pain points:  

Find the right tennis players for free:  

There are some social apps players can make a post and find others to play. But it’s not designed for frequent players and players cannot know the level of the others, which might cause some negative experiences when playing together.  

There are other Apps that require purchase to match tennis player in your area, which could impact the activeness of an App and drive other new users away from the App.  

Know the tennis court condition:  

As a frequent tennis player, you had this experience: browsing through Google Satellite Map in your area and looking for tennis courts and checking the reviews. However, the reviews might lack pictures or it’ outdated. Sometime, some courts are not event list in the search result. 

Another important aspect is the weather condition on the tennis court, so far, we haven’t found a tennis App that integrated with weather and court condition.  

Also, we found it’s difficult to find other non-public court information, such as the membership fee, indoor conditions, hours of operation while only using Google maps. Sometime, the user might need to make a call to ask the club about their court condition. 

Our project would aim to address all the issues above and try to provide a 1-stop tennis partner & court finding solution for our users.  

 

Q2: What three current apps on the Play Store (or other app stores, such as iTunes) 
would be your closest competitors? 

A: Playyourcourt.com; Play Local; TopSpin-Find Tennis Partners. These are the major competitors on the app market. 

 

Q3: Why will your app be better or different than the competitors? 

A: Most of our competitors on the market focus on the social functions such as finding a partner and communication. Our Tennis Mate & Court app has some unique features such as posting reviews about the court’s conditions and real-time information. Our users can make their decisions based on information provided by other users. 

 

Q4: What themes do you see when you browse the reviews of the competitors? 

A: Many users complained about the stability of the app. The idea is great, but the app is buggy, it freezes and crashes when users are trying to book a court. 

 

Q5: What is innovative about your app idea? What will be particularly surprising or  
elegant about the concept?  

Our app takes care of all aspects a tennis player needs. Starting from locating tennis courts, booking courts, finding mates, and reviewing the experience in the end, our user will not feel the need to open another app during the entire process.  

The map function allows user to find and bookmark local tennis courts and upload pictures of the court for others to view. Users can also post reviews of a particular court in terms of availability, environment and accessibility. To book a court, users can check the booking schedule of the court and fit themselves in.  

The group finder function allows users to connect with other players and play together. They can connect and chat to find available times and courts to play tennis. We also plan to add a widget that allows players of the same game to shake their phones to determine their order to serve, similar to spinning your racquet but without damaging or scratching your racquet. 

Sensors & Innovative ideas:  

GPS location service to find local courts 

Using camera for users to upload details of the tennis court surface conditions 

Messaging feature to allow user communications 

Utilizing accelerometer sensor and animated UI design to simulate spinning a racquet.  

 

Q6: What about your app that will keep people engaged using it for a long time, even once  
the novelty wears off? 

A: Socializing is a key feature of our app, and it is also how we maintain long-term user engagement. Our app allows users to communicate in various ways. For example, users can post reviews of the court, or they can send private messages to players whom they are interested in playing with. Our app also features some useful functionalities such as an animated racquet spin tool that acts as a virtual coin-toss process to decide which player serves first in a tennis match. 

 

Q7: What are the top potential weaknesses of your application idea and how will you   
address them?   

A: The biggest challenge we are likely to encounter is how to get enough users to start using our app. Because a lot of information, especially those related to court conditions, relies heavily on user inputs, which could be a big problem if we don’t have a large enough user base to start with. This is also going to affect our initial users who simply cannot find enough players at their desired levels. One possible way to solve this problem is to have some reviews generated by bots. However, this must be done correctly so that normal users won’t be able to recognize them. Those reviews must also be truthful if they aim to provide information about the court, which means we cannot completely start from a blank page, some basic information must be collected and uploaded beforehand to make the app usable. 

 

Q8: Will you be able to design, build, and test this app before the end of the semester? 

A: Yes. We will set up weekly meetings and task agendas to work collaboratively on designing, building, and testing this app before the end of the semester.
